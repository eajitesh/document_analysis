# Document Matching Project

This is part of a research project I am working on to apply robotic process automation to talent acquisition business. One of the aspect of talent acquisition is resume matching based on similarity between job description and resumes. This is where this app and related Java classes would help.

The following are some of the Java classes:
* Stopwords.java: Have methods for removing stop words and applying stemming technique.
* DocumentCosineSimilarity.java: Consist of method for finding similarity between two strings.
